# JS async comparisons

This repository has been started in response to a [simple post](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/damonoehlman.github.io/blob/master/posts/2013/2013-07-23-callbacks-vs-promises-vs-streams.md) comparing a few different async coding approaches available.

I've transferred those examples here along with others suggested in comments so people (including myself) can get some hands on experience with asynchronous coding with simple, but real examples.

Our list of examples at the moment are:

- [child directory reader](/child-dirs)
